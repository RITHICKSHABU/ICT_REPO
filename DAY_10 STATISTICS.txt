Measures of central tendency
 - Mean
 - Median
 - Mode

   The mode is the value that appears the most frequently in your data set .the mode is the highest bar in a bar chart.
 
    5 , 23 , 6 , 9 , 5 , 4 , 9 , 5.
    The mode of the dataset is  5

    5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 4, 9, 5
    The mode of the data set are 9 and 5

 - Percentile

     A percentile is a measure that indicates the percentage of data that is the same as or below that measure
      For example, the 90th percentile indicates that 90% of the data is below that value

 - Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3)

     The first quartile (Q1) is the 25th percentile 
     The second quartile (Q2) is the 50th percentile, also known as the median 
     The third quartile (Q3) is the 75th percentile 

     Talking about Quartiles and percentiles are both ways to divide a set of data into groups. Quartiles divide data           into four equal parts, while percentiles divide data into 100 equal parts. 



 - Interquartile range(IQR = Q3 - Q4)
	The interquartile range (IQR) is the range of the middle 50% of data values 

 - Min( =MIN())
 - Max(=MAX())

Finding outliers using Quartiles
LB = (Q1 - 1.5*IQR)
UB = (Q3 + 1.5*IQR)

Measures of dispersion
 - range
 - variance(=VAR.S())
 - standard deviation(=SQRt())
 - z-score (used for standardization)
 - Confidence Interval (CI)

Correlation coefficient (-1 to 1)
 - Pearson correlation coefficient
 - Sphearman's rank correlation

Scatter plot (Bivariate analysis)
 - Visually inspecting correlation bw two varialbes

Histograms
 - Frequency/relative frequency

Probability density function
